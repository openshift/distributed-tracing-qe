# This script checks the debug exporter output of the OpenTelemetry collector for the
# deduplicated logs of the log_dedup processor.
#
# Two tenants (x-scope-orgid header, configured in metadata_keys) each send the same log 5 times,
# from containers that start together so that both tenants fall into the same processor interval.
# The processor has to keep the tenants apart, so the log_count values of the deduplicated
# records add up to 10 and no single record counts more than 5. Logs that do not match the
# processor condition must pass through unchanged, without a log_count attribute and without the
# first/last observed timestamp attributes.
#
# The debug exporter prints the body of a record before its attributes, so every attribute line is
# attributed to the record whose body was seen last.
